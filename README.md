# Automatic Minecraft Server Deployer
A simple Batch script that automatically downloads, installs and runs Minecraft servers to your liking. <br>
This file format will only work on Windows. If you are willing to convert this into a bash file for mac and linux users please contact me on dicord at Harvo#9744

# How to use
<h3>Make sure you have a working java runtime enviroment, If you do not please download one from <a href="https://java.com">here</a>.<br>
A stable internet connection is needed to download the selected jarfile</h3>

Download and extract the most recent release and run 'AMSD.cmd'

<ul>
<li>To download and install the server, type '1' and press enter</i>
<li>You will be asked to choose a jartype.</li>
<li>Once chosen you will be asked for a version. A list of versions supported can be found <a href="http://34.89.48.29/index.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>The server jar will be downloaded using wget. If this process did not succeed download and install <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm">this</a>, and try again.</li>
<li>Once the wget process is completed you will be asked to enter the minimum amount of RAM allocated to your server. The recomended minimum is 1 Gigabyte (Same goes for Max RAM) So enter <b>1G</b> or <b>1024M</b></li>
<li>Next, you will be asked if AMSD should create a start batch file If you don't need to start the server again after it is closed then you can decline. But it is recomended you should</li>
</ul>
